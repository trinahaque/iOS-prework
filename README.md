## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

I don't have any mobile development or iOS development experience prior to this pre-work. That's why I had to watch some videos on iOS development to get familar with iOS app
buiding process. However, a lot of videos I found used a different version of xcode. As a result, it was difficult to follow through those instructions. After a while, I kind of 
got a hang of it to finish this project. But I am looking forward to learn more about iOS development.
